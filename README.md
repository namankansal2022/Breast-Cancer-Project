Conducted research for the NSW Cancer Institute to examine whether ER-positive breast cancer patients are diagnosed earlier and have better survival outcomes than ER-negative patients, using SEER clinical datasets.
Utilized R for data preprocessing, survival analysis, and visualization. Applied chi-square and log-rank tests to evaluate statistical significance in detection timing and patient survival.
Key findings showed that 17% of ER-positive patients experienced earlier detection, and their median survival was extended by 9 months. Based on this, targeted early screening strategies were recommended for high-risk ER-negative cohorts to the Institute.
